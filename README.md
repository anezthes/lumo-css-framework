# Lumo CSS framework
CSS framework for building web apps using Vaadin's Lumo theme.

## Inspired by Tailwind
To make a potential migration to Tailwind as seamless as possible, similar class names were used.

## Deprecated
The utility classes are now included by default in Vaadin 21+. Continued development will be done there instead.
